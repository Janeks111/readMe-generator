## Description

I have been tasked to create a README file generator to simplify workflow for developers.
When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

The title of my project

Sections entitled:

Description

Table of Contents

Installation

Usage

License

Contributing

Tests

Questions

When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.
When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.
When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.
When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
User is prompted for the project picture links that will be displayed in the README.md
This is all the functionality of the code.
